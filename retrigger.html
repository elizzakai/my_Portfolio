              We generally found problems in the spaces of Independence, Anxiety, Anxiety of Relatives, Safety, Transportation, and Embarrassment.
              We wanted to come up with ideas that would address one or two of these issues thouroughly.
              Through researching about living with epilepsy, we discovered that there were a lot of different states to an epileptic seizure. However, we found the state of confusion, where they could experience memory loss, an interesting space to design & create for. Based on our findings, we developed a solution that enables the person living with epilepsy to regain their memory more independently.

              The targeted users of Retrigger are people that have epileptic seizures that can trigger
              a state of confusion (postical phase), in which they have trouble remembering important things about themselves and enviornment.  

              A key differentiator of this group is that they are most prominently residents of Denmark or EU residents.

              I worked with group to going through the whole design process.
              That included user research: Reviewing Interviews (even with Danish Languae Barriers), and analyzing those findings.
              It also included working on the designs and prototypes for the application, and finally working
              on the physical prototype and presentations, and finally taking feedback to make changes and updates from professors.

              Our idea was under the direction of emotion and was based on the following quote below, where our subject made it clear that epilepsy was not only just an individual condition, but it is also a relative condition, therefore our focus was on something that would emotionally help the relatives and the person with epilepsy.
              
              When interviewing our subjects, we discovered that after they had a seizure, they would lose consciousness. To decrease oneâ€™s recovery time, the subjects would ask questions about themselves to their relatives.
              
              Our idea is to have an object maybe a keychain, that the person with epilepsy can turn on after they have had a seizure. The object will then give information about the person with epilepsy. The object will also be able to track your location and tell you where you are at.
