              We wanted to tackle the problem space of outfit inspiration 
              via the unique route of working specifically with what the user 
              already had. Unlike pinterest, our application would be tailored around what’s already in a user’s wardrobe, providing possible outfits through specific criteria.
              We also wanted to address the key aspect of comfort for clothing by providing
              an outlet to create new oufits out of clothes users were already comfortable wearing.

                The target group were young people, roungly around the ages of 18-22.
                These users want a diversified wardrobe and want to wear different things,
                but may not be able to afford buying new clothing consistently.

                This population of students were most prominetly from Georgia Tech campus.

                We started out with surveying a portion of the Georgia Tech student body 
                to understand what was important to them when creating oufits or buying clothing.

                We identified that comfort came first for many of our users, in addition to 
                working with whats available, as many students had limited budgets for clothing.

                We decided to focus on these key aspects and create an application that helps
                users create new things with already existing clothing.

              The app was well recieved during the final design reviews and presentations.
              Fellow Students commented on its usability for them; It also established a discussion on sustainability.
              I also did learn that we may have spent too much time on the mini features, and we should have focused more on showcasing our main feature
              that actually addresses the problem space that we were trying to solve.

              As a result, I've learned to really focus on designing first and foremost the most imo=portant feature sand focusing on those features
              within presentations so the message and the problem that we are solving is clearer.
              Overall, this was a great learning experience in collaboration and practicing the Design Process.
